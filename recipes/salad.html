    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The classic garden salad is a light and healthy dish with nearly endless variation that can 
      be easily prepared with ingredients you probably already have. Feel free to add to add or omit 
      ingredients or toss with your favorite dressing in place of olive oil and lemon juice.
